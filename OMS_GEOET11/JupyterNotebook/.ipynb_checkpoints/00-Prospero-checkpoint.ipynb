    "This notebook documents the [GEOframe](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2015/03/jgrass-newage-essentials.html) component [`Prospero`](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/ETP/tree/master/src/main/java/prospero) which is intented to estimate evaporation from canopies at point and catchment scale. As a GEOframe component is some Earth Science solution coded Java according to the[OMS v3](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2017/08/oms-3-essentials.html) rules. Prospero is part of a larger set of components which are intended to estimate Evapotranspirantion with different data requirement, including [Priestley Taylor formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penman%E2%80%93Monteith_equation) and the [FAO version of the Penman-Monteith equation](http://www.fao.org/3/X0490E/x0490e04.htm#TopOfPage). These are collected at [Github/Geoframecomponents](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/ETP) and were coded mainly by [Marialaura Bancheri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HUQ60uMAAAAJ&hl=en) and eventually revised by Michele  Bottazzi. \n",
    "`Prospero`'s formulas derive from the assumption that vegetation does not have great thermal capacity and the its energy budget can be simplified accordingly neglecting energy storage. Besides it use the  traditional formulation for vapor and thermal energy transport by turbulence that is encoded in the [Dalton's law of evapotranspiration](https://geoframe.blogspot.com/2020/01/evaporation-and-transpiration.html) and the similar law for thermal energy transport. As in the Penman-Monteith (PM) derivation the independent variables are the temperature of the evaporating surface, $T_{surface}$, the water vapor  pressure in air, $e_a$, the transpiration rate, $E_T$ and the thermal energy transfer $H$. To get a fourth equation, as in the Penman-Monteith treatment, the [Clausius-Clapeyron relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation) is used in a linearized form. However, two changes are made with respect to (PM):  1- It is accounted that leaves can transpire, either from one side or from two sides, according to vegetation species,  while heat exchange happens from both the sides of a leaf; 2 - `Propero` accounts for the the radiative coupling of the evaporating surface with the radiation budget through a proper linearization of the [Stephan-Boltzman law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law). The latter two aspects are taken form a recent [paper by S. Schymanski and D. Or](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/128573) and  they are present, yet in a different way,  in the [G. Bonan (2019) book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1107619076?tag=duc01-21&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1). Extension from leaf to canopies is present in Prospero through a two leaf approach, where the canopy is subdivided in layers exposed to direct sunlight and layers in shadow. \n",
    "The formulation follows a traditional conductance/resistence model. However `Prospero` informatics was designed for inclusion of various approaches to estimanting the conductance by simple addition of a correspondent Java class (the software design  is closed to modification but open to extensions). At present only a Jarvis type of approach is implemented where environmental variables like temperature, photosyntetically active radiation, water availability in soil and vapour deficit are those that decrements transpiration [Michele Bottazzi Ph.D, thesis, Chapter 3](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2020/07/michele-bottazzi-phd-thesis.html). A Ball-Berry type of transpiration and other formulations of transpiration reduction are under implementation. The maximum of stomata conductance is estimated by means of the procedure suggested by Schymanski (MISSING CITATION). The Prospero  component is assumed to work with the short wave and long wave components of GEOframe at hourly scale. These are docuemnted in (MISSING CITATION). If evaporation data are present, the model can be calibrated with the LUCA and Particle Swarm calibrators, available in OMS v3 (MISSING CITATION)"

    "Evaporation and Transpiration account for $30\\%$ to $60\\%$ of the water budget according to the place and the season. To estimate it, various methods were envisioned which are varously described in textbooks (CITE Dingmann, third edition and CITE Brutsaert 2 books). Measuring evapotranspiration is a complex task and prone to errors, there are two main reliable methods (with their own problems) [eddy covariance towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_covariance) and [lysimeters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysimeter), but both of them are local measurements wich cannot account for space variability. Models were use to get a spatial insight or information when only indirect data were available (like temperature, radiation, mean wind velocity, water vapor concentration). Modelling was kept usually simple, through empirical formulation usually quite unreliable, at least untill FAO adopted a modified version of the Penman-Monteith formula (CITE Penman paper on Scientific American) but, above all, provided a series of validated parameters for crops which allowed, at least to guess the order of magnitude of daily transpiration under optimal forecasting conditions. FAO estimation remained short of precision and exposed to various errors specially if applied with not reliable input data of temperature and radiation but is a reasonable and widely used starting point (CITE ALLEN). Satellite products pretends to give evaporation estimantes, but they are also modelling based on the same basis of FAO, some hydrologic model and measure of indirect quantities (see for instance the [GLEAM](https://www.gleam.eu/) product. There are big unknowns in evaporation and transpiration estimate problem. Primarily the behavior of the atmosphere that wipes out water output, and which is usually thought as homogeneous, well developed, and within an atmosphere in neutral conditions; the role of vegetation physiology in closing stomata and its (vegetation) reaction to draughts, and finally the status of the soil humidity and its use by plants. So it remains even today a challenge for research. `Prospero` model try to consistenly evolve the Penman-Monteith approach to include recent new insights in an extensible informatics. The extensions are possible in those areas in which the present research is increasing fast."

It was produced as part of the Ph.D. work by Michele Bottazzi. \n",
    "It has already extensively used by the students of the Hydrology class at the University of Trento for their simulations of transpiration. Main reference for understanding its theoretical foundations is the [Ph.D. dissertation by Michele Bottazzi](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2020/07/michele-bottazzi-phd-thesis.html) which includes a review of the theory and some applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make it run the user must first download the `OMS3` console and learn a little bit of OMS3 (information can be found, for instance, [here](https://geoframe.blogspot.com/2020/01/gws2020-getting-started-with-oms-and.html)). An example project can be found [here](https://osf.io/uxd2q/) together with the appropriate Notebooks documentation. Tools in Python (scripting level) are also provided to treat input and putput data. The execution in OMS is driven by `.sim` files and browsing them in the examples discloses most of the information a user can require. It is then clear that the reader who wants to become a user must first go through some steps of self-instruction in using those tools (OMS3, OMS3 console) and understand how sim files work. This is a task to perform once forever in using OMS3/GEOframe tools, and the scope can be worthwhile if you are interested to hydrology. However, the occasional reader can have most of the general information from here below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evapotranspiration is driven by radiation and therefore `Prospero` requires to run a radiation module whch produces shortwave and longwave downwelling radiation. These modules are well documented theoretically at [Rigon, 2012](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2012/12/solar-radiation-physics-and-geometry.html), while the GEOframe modules where objects of two papers (Formetta et al, 20XX ;Formetta et al. 20FF;). These modules have their own complexity that must be understood, and include two main sources of radiation modulation: the atmosphere with its transmittances (to be calibrated) and the geometry of the terrain altering the energy flux, the angle of view and the shadows due to the topography. (XXXX NOTE: CAN PROSPERO, IN PRINCIPLE, RUN WITH JUST RADIATION INPUTS CONTAINED IN FILES, without elaborating in \"real time\" the radiation ?XXXX).
