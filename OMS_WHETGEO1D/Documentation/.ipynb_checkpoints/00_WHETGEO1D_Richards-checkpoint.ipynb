    "The Earth’s Critical Zone (CZ) is defined as the _heterogeneous, near surface environment in which complex interactions involving rock, soil, water, air, and living organism regulate the natural habitat and determine the availability of life-sustaining resources_ [Lin, H., 2010](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-14-25-2010). Clear interest in the studying the CZ is given by the ever-increasing pressure due to the growth in human population, wealth, and climatic changes. Central to simulate the processes in the CZ  is the study of soil moisture dynamics. \n",

The rainfall intensity exceeds the actual infiltration rate so water builds up at the soil surface (blue line). Panel (b) shows the time evolution of the water suction within the soil. From the numerical point of view, as water builds up at the soil surface it would be necessary to switch the boundary condition, from Neumann type to Dirichlet type.\n",

    "`WHETGEO-1D` model solves the so called mixed - or conservative - formulation of the Richards' equation. The novelty regards the use of the nested Newton-Casulli-Zanolli (NCZ) algorithm, ([Casulli and Zanolli, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1137/100786320)) to linearize the nonlinear system resulting from the approximation of the governing equation. Using the enthalpy formulation and the NCZ algorithm the convergence of the solver is guarateed for any time step size. This is a key feature since the integration time step can be choosen accordingly to the time scale of the processes to study, from seconds to days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the definition of the type of surface boundary condition (Neumann vs.  Dirchlet ones) for the Richards' equation is a ’non a trivial task’ since it can depend on the state of the system. In literature several approaches are used ([Furman, 2008](https://doi.org/10.2136/vzj2007.0065)).  These approaches are mainly based on a switch of the type of the boundary condition from a prescribed head to prescribed flux and viceversa.  This switching often causes numerical difficulties that need to be addressed ([Furman, 2008](https://doi.org/10.2136/vzj2007.0065)). To overcome this problem we included an addition computational node at the soil surface that represents the water depth at the soil surface ([Casulli, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.1896)).\n"

An example project can be found [](https://github.com/GEOframeOMSProjects/OMS_FreThaw1D) together with the appropriate Notebooks documentation. Tools in Python (scripting level) are also provided to treat input and output data. The execution in OMS is driven by `.sim` files and browsing them in the examples discloses most of the information a user can require. It is then clear that the reader who wants to become a user must first go through some steps of self-instruction in using those tools (OMS3, OMS3 console) and understand how sim files work. This is a task to perform once forever in using OMS3/GEOframe tools, and the scope can be worthwhile if you are interested to hydrology. However, the occasional reader can have most of the general information from here below. \n",

    "In literature there are several formulations of the SWRC. In WHETGEO 1D different models were implemented for the runtime choice of the model to use. From the informatics design point of view, the SWRC models were encapsulated by using the Simple Factory design pattern ([Freeman et al. 2008](freeman2008)). The abstract class `it.geoframe.blogspot.closureequation.closureequation.ClosureEquation` is defined and it contains only abstract methods. The abstract class is similar to built-in types. The implementation of these methods is demanded to the concrete classes, one for each SWRC model.\n",
    "The Simple Factory responds to the OO principles: _Program to an interface, not an implementation_ and _open for extension but close for modification_ ([Freeman et al. 2008](freeman2008)) (polymorphism). By preferring polymorphism to inheritance, the developers can easily include - extend existing code - new formulation/parametrization of SWRC. Besides, the Simple Factory fulfils the _dependency inversion principle_ ([Eckel, 2003](eckel2003)} thus new extensions cannot affect the functioning of existing code. \n",

    "The standard approach to add a new soil water retention curve is to define a new class that extends the abstract class `it.geoframe.blogspot.closureequation.closureequation.ClosureEquation`. The new class must override the abstract methods defined in the parent class. Hence it is necessary to update the `it.geoframe.blogspot.closureequation.closureequation.SoilWaterRetentionCurveFactory`."
