    "The input and output are handled with Python. We suggest to use Anaconda to install Python and all the required packages. In order to facilitate the installation we provide a [Conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) containg all the required packages. The `geoframe_verona.yaml` file can be downloaded from [python4GEOframe](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/python4GEOframe).\n",
    "\n",
    "After having installed [Anconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) the Conda environment can be created following these steps:\n",
    "- open Anaconda prompt\n",
    "- set in the folder containing the file *geoframe_verona.yaml*\n",
    "-  `conda env create -f geoframe_verona.yaml`\n",
    "-  `conda activate geoframe_verona`\n",

    "The output are stored in [NetCDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF). [Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/handling-netcdf-files-using-xarray-for-absolute-beginners-111a8ab4463f) an introduction on how to read a NetCDF file using the python library [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/).\n",
